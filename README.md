iClickerPoll
============

iClickerPoll is a Python interface to the iClicker base unit.
It should be compatible with an operating system that supports
libusb, and in particular, GNU/Linux.


Requirements
------------

* Python 2.x/3.x
* pyusb

To start a poll, run iclickerpoll.py with the desired arguments.
For example:

To stop the poll, use Ctrl+C to terminate iclickerpoll.py.  At
this point, iclickerpoll.py will send the closing sequence to
the iclicker base station and save any data if requested (with --dest).
